IP-location Waybar weather plugin
=====================

This plugin does not use the [One Call API from OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3).
You don't need to have an active subscription, and with normal usage you should never go over the free limit of 1000 request per day.
Instead, you need to obtain a free API-key from [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
My refresh setting for the waybar plugin is 600s.


## set your APIKEY and preferences

In your ~/.bashrc add the following definition and place your APIKEY in there

```bash
    # waybar weather settings:
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_APIKEY="<YOUR OpenWeatherMap API KEY>"                                    # Get one from their website
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_DEF_POSTAL=<YOUR default zip code>                                        # For when you want another place as fallback
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_UNITS="metric"                                                            # General units (metric[°C and m/s] / imperial[°F and mph] / metric_simple[° and m/s] / standard[K and m/sec])
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_ICON_UNITS="metric_simple"                                                # What appears in your waybar (not the tooltip)
```
I recommend to set your settings in a sort of "start-script" for both them and waybar. This way you can make sure that they are loaded in the correct place at the correct time (or just do whatever works for you).
I use a .sh file in the following format:

```bash
    # waybar weather settings:
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_APIKEY="<YOUR OpenWeatherMap API KEY>"                                    
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_DEF_POSTAL=<YOUR default zip code>                                       
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_UNITS="metric"
    export WAYBAR_WEATHER_ICON_UNITS="metric_simple"

    exec waybar
```

Which I load in my hyprland config in two ways:
```bash
    exec-once = /home/<username>/.config/waybar/<...>/<name>.sh
    ...                           
    bind = $mainMod, W, exec, killall waybar; /home/<username>/.config/waybar/<...>/<name>.sh
```

If you find this unnecessary, great. At least this will help my future self then.
